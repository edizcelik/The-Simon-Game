# The-Simon-Game
An implementation of the electronic memory game Simon. It generates a series of random tones and lights, and expects user to repeat this series. When the user makes a mistake, it repeats the last step as a remainder to the user. If strict mode is selected and the user presses wrong button, it restarts the game with a new pattern. User can see his/her progress through a counter screen available on the board.
